    <string name="melanocytic_navi">A melanocytic naevus (American spelling ‘nevus’), or mole, is a common benign
        skin lesion due to a local proliferation of pigment cells (melanocytes).
        It is sometimes called a naevocytic naevus or just \'naevus\' (but note
        that there are other types of naevi). A brown or black melanocytic naevus contains the pigment
        melanin, so may also be called a pigmented naevus.A melanocytic naevus can be
        present at birth (a congenital melanocytic naevus) or appear later (an acquired naevus).
        There are various kinds of congenital and acquired melanocytic naevi (American spelling \'nevi\')</string>
